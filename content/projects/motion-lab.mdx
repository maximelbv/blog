# About this project

The Motion Lab is a personal project where I experiment with web animations and interactions. 
It serves as a space to test ideas, explore modern technologies like GSAP and Three.js, 
and refine techniques in creative coding. The goal is to build and showcase small, 
interactive projects that push the boundaries of web design and development while maintaining 
a clean and minimal aesthetic.
