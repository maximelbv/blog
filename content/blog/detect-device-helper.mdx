This TypeScript helper provides a simple way to distinguish between mouse and touch-based devices.
Works client-side with a fallback for server-side rendering.


```ts
const DEVICE_MOUSE = "mouse";
const DEVICE_TOUCH = "touch";

type DeviceType = typeof DEVICE_MOUSE | typeof DEVICE_TOUCH;

function isClient(): boolean {
  return typeof window !== "undefined";
}

export function getDeviceType(): DeviceType {
  if (!isClient()) {
    return DEVICE_MOUSE;
  }

  const isMouse = window.matchMedia("(pointer: fine)").matches;

  return isMouse ? DEVICE_MOUSE : DEVICE_TOUCH;
}
```

## How to use (example with React)

```tsx
import { getDeviceType } from "./deviceHelper";

export const DeviceMessage = () => {
    const device = getDeviceType();

    return (
      <p>
        {device === "mouse"
          ? "You are on a desktop or laptop."
          : "You are on a touch device."}
      </p>
    );
  };
```
