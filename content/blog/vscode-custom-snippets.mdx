In this article, we will explore what code snippets are, how to set up custom snippets
in Visual Studio Code, and ways to optimize them for better performance.

By the end, youâ€™ll have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage snippets to streamline your coding workflow.

# What is a snippet ?

A code snippet is a small block of reusable code that you can quickly insert into your programs.
In VS Code, snippets help developers avoid repetitive tasks by providing a quick way to generate
common code structures.

They can be accessed through VS Code extensions (if you use React, i highly
recommend installing <CustomLink isExternal href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets'>this one</CustomLink>)
but you can also create your own personalized snippets, let's see how to do that !

# Your first custom snippet

<Step number={1} title="Set up a new snippets file">
  - In VS Code, open your command palette with <KeyboardKey value="CMD" /> +
  <KeyboardKey value="SHIFT" /> + <KeyboardKey value="P" /> (macOS) / <KeyboardKey value="CTRL" /> +
  <KeyboardKey value="SHIFT" /> + <KeyboardKey value="P" /> (Windows / Linux) and search for <strong>Snippets: Configure User Snippets</strong>

- Select <strong>New Global Snippets file</strong> and name it. (You can also create a snippet file especially for your project or for a specific language, feel free to choose an option that suits your needs)

</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Understand the structure">

By generating the file, you will se a bunch of informations and a default example at the end, you can uncomment it.

Let's see how it is structured:

```json
"Print to console": {
  "scope": "javascript,typescript",
  "prefix": "log",
  "body": [
    "console.log('$1');",
    "$2"
  ],
  "description": "Log output to console"
}
```

```css
pre {
  overflow-x: auto;
  padding: 1rem 0;
}

pre [data-line] {
  padding: 0 1rem;
}
```

Here, we have a snippet that prints a value to the console.
The `scope` defines where ths snippet is applicable. In this case, the snippet works in .js ans .ts files.

</Step>
