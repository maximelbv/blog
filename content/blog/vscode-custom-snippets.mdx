In this article, we will explore what code snippets are, how to set up custom snippets
in Visual Studio Code, and ways to optimize them for better performance.

By the end, you‚Äôll have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage snippets to streamline your coding workflow.

# What is a snippet ?

A code snippet is a small block of reusable code that you can quickly insert into your programs.
In VS Code, snippets help developers avoid repetitive tasks by providing a quick way to generate
common code structures.

They can be accessed through VS Code extensions (if you use React, i highly
recommend installing <CustomLink isExternal href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets'>this one</CustomLink>)
but you can also create your own personalized snippets, let's see how to do that !

# Your first custom snippet

<Step number={1} title="Set up a new snippets file">
  In VS Code, open your command palette with <KeyboardKey value="CMD" /> +
  <KeyboardKey value="SHIFT" /> + <KeyboardKey value="P" /> (macOS) / <KeyboardKey value="CTRL" /> +
  <KeyboardKey value="SHIFT" /> + <KeyboardKey value="P" /> (Windows / Linux) and search for <strong>Snippets: Configure User Snippets</strong>

Select <strong>New Global Snippets file</strong> and name it. (You can also create a snippet file especially for your project or for a specific language, feel free to choose an option that suits your needs)

</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Understand the structure">

By generating the file, you will se a bunch of informations and a default example at the end, you can uncomment it.

Let's see how it is structured:

```json {2}#purple {3}#green {4}#blue {8}#red
"Print to console": {
  "scope": "javascript,typescript",
  "prefix": "log",
  "body": [
    "console.log('$1');",
    "$2"
  ],
  "description": "Log output to console"
}
```

Here, we have a snippet that prints a value to the console.

<ColorLegend color={"purple"}>
  The `scope` defines where this snippet is applicable. In this case, the
  snippet works in javascript ans typescriptP files
</ColorLegend>

<ColorLegend color={"green"}>
  The `prefix` is the acronym that you will type to invoke the snippet
</ColorLegend>

<ColorLegend color={"blue"}>
  The `body` contains the code that will be displayed
</ColorLegend>

<ColorLegend color={"red"}>
  The `description` will show up in the autocomplete suggestions
</ColorLegend>

Save this file, and open a new one with the .js extension, <br/>
by typing 'log' you should see the vscode autocomplete suggestion for the snippet we just described, well done !

</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Tab stops, default value & multiple values">
We now have the keys to create our custom snippets... <br/>But did you notice the `$1` and `$2` ?

```json /$1/ /$2/
"Print to console": {
  "scope": "javascript,typescript",
  "prefix": "log",
  "body": [
    "console.log('$1');",
    "$2"
  ],
  "description": "Log output to console"
}
```

These are **Tab Stops**, they define where the cursor will be placed at:

- `$1` : initial position
- `$2` : second position (after pressing <KeyboardKey value='TAB' />)
- `$0` : last position

This is not mandatory, but very helpfull if you have multiple values to add to your snippet. By default, the cursor is placed at the end of the body

### Default values

We can also define default values for tab stops that will automatically be highlighted.<br />
Simply replace the `$1` by `${1:Your default value}`,

If i take the previous example and replace the `$1` by `${1:Hello world}`, this will result to :

<AutoplayVideo
  src="/blog-assets/snippets-default-value.mov"
  style={{ maxWidth: "70%" }}
/>

the default value will be selected and so, easily replaceable üëç

It also works with multiple values, simply enclose the values between `||` chars :

For example: `console.${2|log,error,table|}(${1:Hello world})` will result to :

<AutoplayVideo
  src="/blog-assets/snippets-multiple-values.mov"
  style={{ maxWidth: "70%" }}
/>

</Step>

# Conclusion

That's all folks! <br />
You now have the keys to create basic custom snippets in vscode
