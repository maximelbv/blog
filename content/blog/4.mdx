{/* <h2 className="text-[22px] !mt-0">What is a snippet ?</h2> */}

A snippet in VS code is a template of code that you can invoke with a defined keyword.
VS Code provides snippets through built-in features and extensions. You can also create 
custom snippets to fit your needs :

- Open your Command Palette : <KeyboardKey value="CMD" /> / <KeyboardKey value="CTRL" />  + <KeyboardKey value="SHIFT" /> + <KeyboardKey value="P" />
- Search for "Snippets: Configure User Snippets"
- Select the file type that you need (Global / for a project / for a language)
