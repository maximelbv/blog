On Chrome, if you have the dev tools open, you can press and hold the refresh button to see reload options:


<div className='max-w-[400px]'>
  <img src="/static/images/blog/chrome-hard-reload/illustration.png" />
</div>

in particular, there's the `empty cache + hard reload` option, which can be very useful.

⚠️ make sure you have the dev tools open, otherwise it won't work.
