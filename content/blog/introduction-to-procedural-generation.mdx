You’ve probably heard about procedural generation in games like **Minecraft** or **No Man’s Sky**,
where it’s used to create endless and unique landscapes and ecosystems.

Procedural generation goes far beyond that, it’s a powerful tool across <u>**many**</u> industries. 
In this article, however, we’ll focus on its applications specifically in **3D rendering** 
(Video games, Cinema, Animation, Architecture, Scientific simulations, ...).

# Part 1: Random !

The first step in procedural generation is to introduce randomness. But 
not just any kind of randomness. For many applications, pure 
randomness is too chaotic and disconnected. What we often need is **randomness with 
structure**, a type of controlled variation that feels smooth and natural.

Take the example above, the first chart illustrates pure random values. 
These values are entirely **independent of each other**, resulting in 
abrupt changes. While this type of randomness can 
be useful in certain scenarios, it often falls short when it comes to 
simulating natural or organic patterns.

The second chart showcases a more structured approach known as **Perlin noise**, 
a technique among others that introduces a sense of continuity. By ensuring 
**neighboring values are similar**, it produces smoother transitions that are ideal 
for generating lifelike textures, flowing landscapes, and organic forms.

## The Perlin Noise

The Perlin noise algorithm is one of the most popular techniques for adding 
structure to randomness. Its ability to produce smooth and continuous variations 
has made it a go-to solution for many applications, let’s take a closer look at how it works:

On a digital canvas, each pixel is assigned a brightness value **between 0 and 100**, 
with 0 representing pure black and 100 pure white. However, as we’ve seen, it’s 
not just about assigning random values to each pixel. There’s a gradual transition 
between neighboring values, creating smooth changes across the canvas :
