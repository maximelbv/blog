Have you ever wondered, “How does games like Minecraft create unique and infinite worlds ? Do the developers painstakingly 
design every detail by hand for each ?” <br /> 
The answer is no, thankfully.

<SpacerS />

They use a technique called **procedural generation**. Simply put, it’s a method that uses 
algorithms to automatically generate complex and varied content. 

<SpacerS />

In video games, procedural generation is used for a wide range of tasks: creating realistic 
textures, generating landscapes, designing NPC behavior, populating dungeons, simulating dynamic 
weather systems, etc ...

<SpacerS />

This technology enables developers to build vast and immersive worlds that feel alive and varied 
with minimal manual effort.

<SpacerS />

So, how does it work ?

# Random !

The first step in procedural generation is to create randomness. But 
not just any kind of randomness. For many applications, pure 
randomness is too chaotic and disconnected. What we often need is **randomness with 
structure**, a type of controlled variation that feels smooth and natural.

<SpacerS />

Take the example above, the chart illustrates pure random values. 
These values are entirely **independent of each other**, resulting in 
abrupt changes. While this type of randomness can 
be useful in certain scenarios, it often falls short when it comes to 
simulating natural or organic patterns.

This chart showcases a more structured approach known as **Perlin noise**, 
a technique among others that introduces a sense of continuity. By ensuring 
**neighboring values are similar**, it produces smoother transitions that are ideal 
for generating lifelike textures, flowing landscapes, and organic forms.

## The Perlin Noise

The Perlin noise is one of the most popular algorithms for procedural generation. 
Its ability to produce smooth and continuous variations 
has made it a solution for many applications, let’s take a closer look at how it works:

<SpacerS />


On a digital canvas, each pixel is assigned a brightness value **between 0 and 100**, 
with 0 representing pure black and 100 pure white. However, as we’ve seen, it’s 
not just about assigning random values to each pixel. There’s a gradual transition 
between neighboring values, creating smooth changes across the canvas :

If you want to dive deeper into Perlin noise and understand how it's generated, 
I recommend reading <CustomLink isExternal href="https://rtouti.github.io/graphics/perlin-noise-algorithm">this article</CustomLink>from Raouf Touti.

<SpacerS />

We will use this algorithm for the next steps, but be aware that many others exist for various purposes.


# 🌱 The Seed

Have you noticed the _"seed"_ field with a value of 42 in the component above? <br />
Try changing it and see what happens.

<SpacerS />

When you alter the seed, the generated noise shifts entirely. This happens because the 
seed acts as the starting point for the random number generator that powers the procedural 
generation algorithm.

<SpacerS />

The seed **42** will always generate the same result from the algorithm. Think of it as **the DNA of your noise**,
the seed ensures that random patterns can be reproduced. 

<SpacerS />

You may be familiar with this concept if you ever played Minecraft. Using the same seed 
as your friend generates identical worlds, allowing you to explore the same terrain.


<Callout>
<span>Although seed is a key parameter, other settings also influence procedural noise generation. 
**Scale, frequency, persistence and octave** let you fine-tune the complexity and detail of the generated pattern.
However, our aim here is to understand the fundamental concepts so let’s keep things simple and stick to 
the essentials for now.</span>
