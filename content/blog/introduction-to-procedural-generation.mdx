In this article, we explore what procedural generation is and how it’s applied to create virtual worlds.
This is not a step-by-step tutorial but rather an opportunity to demystify the concept and 
inspire curiosity about its possibilities.

<SpacerM />

Procedural generation is a technique used in game development to create content algorithmically 
instead of manually. It allows developers to produce environments, objects, and experiences that 
feel organic without designing every element by hand.

# Use cases

- ## World generation <br />
  <ImagesGrid columns={2} images={[{src:"/images/blog/procedural-generation/2.webp"}, {src:"/images/blog/procedural-generation/1.png"}]} />
  The most known use of this process is terrain, biomes, and ecosystems dynamic creation.
  _Minecraft_ is a good example of that. Each new world is unique, thanks to the procedural generation.

- ## Dynamic Level Design <br />
  <ImagesGrid columns={2} images={[{src:"/images/blog/procedural-generation/3.webp"}, {src:"/images/blog/procedural-generation/4.gif"}]} />
  Especially in roguelite games, procedural generation is used to create the dynamic level designs. 
  In _The binding of Isaac_, for example, rooms are designed by hand, but their layout is dynamically generated, 
  making each run unique.

- ## Texture and Asset Creation <br />
  <ImagesGrid columns={2} images={[{src:"/images/blog/procedural-generation/5.jpg"}, {src:"/images/blog/procedural-generation/6.jpg"}]} />
  Creating visual details on a massive scale can be overwhelming, but procedural generation makes it manageable. 
  Surfaces, patterns, and objects can be generated dynamically, ensuring that even the smallest details contribute 
  to a world’s uniqueness. This approach adds richness without requiring endless manual work.

- ## NPC Behavior and Quests <br />
  <ImagesGrid columns={2} images={[{src:"/images/blog/procedural-generation/7.avif"}, {src:"/images/blog/procedural-generation/8.png"}]} />
  NPC's can modulate their dialogues, movements, routines, and behavior towards the player, 
  to make them seem more realistic. good examples are Skyrim or RDR2.

as you've seen, procedural generation is involved in almost every aspect of video game creation. 
Hovewer, in this article, we're going to understand how it works through the example of a **world creation**.
So where do we start ?

# Step 1 : Random !

The first step is of course to create randomness, but not just any kind of randomness.

<SpacerS />

For many applications, pure randomness is too chaotic and disconnected. Take the example below,
the chart illustrates pure random values. 
These values are entirely **independent of each other**, resulting in 
abrupt changes.

<SpacerM />

<BarChartRandom />

<SpacerM />

While this type of randomness can 
be useful in certain scenarios, it often falls short when it comes to 
simulating natural or organic patterns. What we often need is **randomness with 
structure**, a type of controlled variation that feels smooth and natural :

<SpacerM />

<BarChartProcedural />

<SpacerM />

This chart showcases a more structured approach known as **Perlin noise**, 
a technique among others that introduces a sense of continuity. 

<SpacerS />

By ensuring 
**neighboring values are similar**, it produces smoother transitions that are ideal 
for generating lifelike textures, flowing landscapes, and organic forms.

<SpacerM />

## Understand what is a noise

In the context of procedural generation, a noise is a type of **mathematical function**
that generates values distributed across a space, with a certain continuity and coherence.
You don’t need to understand how it’s made, just how it works and how it can be applied.

<SpacerM />

The **Perlin noise** that we used is one of them. 
Its ability to produce smooth and continuous variations 
has made it a solution for many applications, let’s take a closer look at how it works:

<SpacerM />


On a digital canvas, each pixel is assigned a brightness value **between 0 and 100**, 
with 0 representing pure black and 100 pure white. However, as we’ve seen, it’s 
not just about assigning random values to each pixel. There’s a gradual transition 
between neighboring values, creating smooth changes across the canvas.

<SpacerM />

Hover your mouse over the image to zoom in and see its details. You'll notice each pixel's 
brightness value and the smooth transitions between them :

<SpacerM />

<PerlinNoiseGenerator />

<SpacerM />

That is basically the concept of Perlin noise. However, if you’re curious about how it’s made, 
I recommend reading <CustomLink isExternal href="https://rtouti.github.io/graphics/perlin-noise-algorithm">this article</CustomLink>from Raouf Touti.

<SpacerM />

We will rely on this algorithm for the next steps, but keep in mind that 
there are many others designed for different purposes, some examples are :

<ImagesGrid columns={2} images={[

  {src:"/images/blog/procedural-generation/worley-noise.jpg", alt: "Worley noise"},
  {src:"/images/blog/procedural-generation/white-noise.avif", alt: "White noise (yes the one from the TV's !)"},
  {src:"/images/blog/procedural-generation/simplex-noise.jpg", alt: "Simplex noise"},
]}/>

## 🌱 The Seed

We won’t dive too deep into the details, but before moving on, I want to introduce an 
important concept in noise generation: **the seed**.

<SpacerS />

You may have noticed the "seed" field with the value 42 in the perlin noise generator component,
but what is this ? and why does the noise change when i change the seed value ?

<AutoplayVideo src="/images/blog/procedural-generation/seed-change.mov" />

When you change the seed, you change the entire noise pattern because the seed is the **initial 
input that drives the generator**. 

<SpacerS />

Think of it like planting a tomato seed in a garden : it will always grow into a tomato plant. 
If you plant a sunflower seed instead, you’ll get a completely different result. 

<SpacerS />

In procedural generation, the seed works the same way. It’s the starting point that determines 
the entire outcome. Keep the seed the same, and you’ll always recreate the same result; change it, 
and you’ll get something entirely new.
<SpacerS />

You may be familiar with this concept if you ever played Minecraft. Using the same seed 
as your friend generates identical worlds, allowing you to explore the same terrain.

# Step 2 : Turning noise into relief

Remember our Perlin noise grid with values between 0 and 100 ? We can 
reinterpret these values as **elevation levels**. For instance, a value of 0 in your 
noise could correspond to the bottom of a cavern, while a value of 100 might be a mountain peak.

<SpacerS />

## Adding Granularity with Octaves

Octaves let us add more detail to a terrain by layering multiple 
versions of the same noise with different levels of detail.

[représentation visuelle d'une octave]

The first layer defines the broad shapes, and each additional layer adds smaller variations on top. 
The more layers we add, the more complex and natural the terrain looks, avoiding repetitive or artificial patterns.

[Interactive octave adjuster ?]


# Step 3: Adding details

At this stage, we have a basic terrain, but it still looks flat and lifeless. 
To make it more visually interesting and realistic, we need to add details like textures, 
biomes, and environmental variations.

## Texture Mapping

We can map different textures onto the terrain based on elevation thresholds. For example:
<div className="article-layout my-4 !text-[19px]">
  <ColorLegend color={"blue"}>**0–20** : Water (oceans or lakes)</ColorLegend>
  <ColorLegend color={"yellow"}>**20–40** : Beaches or low-lying areas</ColorLegend>
  <ColorLegend color={"green"}>**40–60** : Grasslands</ColorLegend>
  <ColorLegend color={"darkGreen"}>**60–80** : Hills</ColorLegend>
  <ColorLegend color={"white"}>**80–100** : Mountain peaks</ColorLegend>
</div>

vue isometrique avec les legendes qui pointent sur les layers (voir l'exemple de mc?)]

## Environmental Factors

Textures alone aren’t enough to define a biome. Two regions at the same altitude 
can have completely different environments, a desert and a jungle, for example. 

<SpacerS />

To refine our terrain, we introduce additional noise layers to control key factors:

Humidity → Determines if an area is wet (jungle, swamp) or dry (desert, steppe).
Temperature → Influences biome types (cold tundra, warm savanna).
Proximity to Water → Affects vegetation, enabling forests near rivers and barren land in isolated areas.
Soil Type → Impacts plant growth (fertile land, rocky surfaces, sandy terrain).
Slope and Erosion → Steep areas may be rocky cliffs, while flatter zones allow vegetation to spread.

Just like the elevation map, some of these factors are generated using separate noise maps 
with their own scale and frequency.

[exemple visuel d'une noise map adaptée a l'humidité]
[exemple visuel d'une noise map adaptée a la temperature]

Other factors, like proximity to water and slope, are derived directly from the elevation map. 
Instead of generating new noise, we analyze the terrain’s shape, calculating distances to water 
bodies or detecting steep areas, to determine how these factors influence the environment.

[exemple visuel ?]

By layering these data maps together, we create a strong foundation for biome generation.

[Exemple visuel d'un noise qui illustre le taux d'humidité en fonction du number]

## Biome Generation

Now that we have elevation, textures, and environmental factors, we can combine these layers to define biomes. 
We now consider multiple conditions together:

Temperature and Humidity → Determine the overall biome type (desert, forest, tundra, etc.).
Proximity to Water → Affects vegetation density—forests grow near rivers, while drylands stay barren.
Elevation and Slope → Influence terrain variation—flat areas become plains or swamps, steep zones form 
mountains or cliffs.

By layering these factors, we assign a biome to each region and apply the right elements: trees, grass, snow, ...
to bring the world to life.

## Going Further

I won’t go into every possible application of procedural generation in terrain creation, 
this article is already quite long. What matters is that you understand the core concept. 
After all, the goal here isn’t to provide concrete implementations but rather an overall understanding.

<SpacerS />

There are countless ways to enrich a world through procedural techniques: erosion simulation, 
vegetation growth, wildlife generation, NPC placement, dynamic weather systems, and much more.

# Conclusion

In this article, we demystified what procedural generation is through the example of 
one of its applications, but as you'd expect, procedural generation goes far beyond that.

If this introduction has caught your attention, i highly encourage you to dive in and experiment 
procedural generation for yourself. You'll find a wealth of content online for all levels and 
applications.
