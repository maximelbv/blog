Did you know you can update your favicon dynamically depending on the user's theme preference? 
This small trick enhances UX and keeps your branding consistent across light and dark modes.

## How it works

Add these two `<link>{:html}` tags in your HTML `<head>{:html}` section:

```html
<link href="favicon.png" rel="icon" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)">
<link href="favicon-dark.png" rel="icon" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
```

`media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)"` Uses the light favicon when the userâ€™s device is set to light mode.

`media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"` Switches to the dark favicon for dark mode.
