          I am a web developer based in Paris. I started my journey into web
          development four years ago after a career retraining, and since then,
          I have built a solid foundation in creating complete, dynamic web
          solutions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently, I am nearing the completion of a work-study program, where
          I have gained valuable experience in building web applications that
          seamlessly integrate design with functionality. My expertise lies in
          designing and implement full-stack applications that are both robust
          and scalable.
          <br />
          <br />I am dedicated to continuous learning and sharing my knowledge
          with others, which is why Iâ€™ve decided to start this blogâ€”to
          contribute to the web development community and help others on their
          journey.
